The ``astrospice`` package contains tools for downloading SPICE kernels and
generating astropy coordinates from them. SPICE kernels are used to describe
the geometry of bodies within the solar system - this includes their orbits and
orientations. For more information, see https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/
